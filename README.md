Developed a machine learning model to accurately classify news articles as genuine or fake and developed a reliable tool for identifying and filtering misinformation.

Leveraged Siamese Network architecture for binary classification tasks involving similarity/distance measures where it was trained to distinguish between two classes with high accuracy. Analyzed performance metrics to identify the Siamese Network model as the most effective, achieving an exceptional accuracy of 95.44%.

The project employed a comprehensive approach, encompassing data preparation, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison. This systematic method allows for informed selection of the most suitable model for real-world fake news detection tasks.
